# Introduction

![](/assets/cozinha.jpeg)

In this book we present **programming** concepts regarding **cooking** tasks. Readers are not supposed to be chefs in order to understand presented concepts. Metaphors are used to explain these concepts easily. Discussed concepts range from basic to advanced ones. Last requires some programming experience.

Before presenting programming concepts, we made some metaphors regarding computers like hardware components. In fact, these metaphors apply to many electronic devices, like mobile phones, tables, robots, microwaves, etc.

In this picture, **Processor** is the system's brain where all processing is controlled. Although it has processing power and speed, it would be useless alone. Then we have the other 4 blocks in the picture: the **Memory**, the **Input**, **Output** and **Storage** devices.

**Memory**, also called main memory or RAM (Random Access Memory), is responsible for fast storage of information. Our brain has a portion that does the same. When we need to memorise a phone number before we register it in a mobile phone, we use this portion. Information is recorded and erased easily at this portion. All stored information is lost when computer power is down.

When we want to store information regardless computer power, we use **Storage Devices**. When we want to save a phone number for later use, we have many options: notebooks, mobile phone agenda, etc. Computers also have many options: hard disks, memory cards, CD-ROM, etc. These devices are slower than main memory but store for long time.

To perceive an environment is another crucial issue to provide information to our brain. Our five senses (taste, sight, touch, smell and sound) allow us to recognize and communicate with an environment. Computers have **Input Devices** (keyboard, mouse, microphone, etc) and **Output Devices** (screen, printer, etc) to do so. Arrows orientation at the picture above indicate data flow direction.

Below we present metaphors relating those concepts and kitchens.

## Computer

A **kitchen** is related to a **computer**. A computer runs programs as long as kitchens are used to be prepare meals. A person uses a computer in order to automate tasks required by another person or company. Meals are prepared when there are hungry clients.

## Main Memory

Since kitchens are related to computers, in order to describe the metaphor completely each cooking utensil should be related to a computer component. For instance, **sinks** and **stands** are computer main memory. Both are used to store things (food or data) for a short period. Cooking utensils, ingredients and recipes are stored for cooking faster.

Sinks and stands should be always clean. It speeds up preparing next meal and improves hygiene. Cleaning is also important because sinks and stands have limited space. Computer main memory must be used in this way. Otherwise, programs may run slowly.

When space available at sinks and stands are not enough, an extra space must be arranged. In a computer this extra space is called **virtual memory** and is located in a particular place in the hard disk. In a kitchen, this extra space may be located in a kitchen cabinet or any other place close to the sink and stand. This place must be close because things physically or virtually located at a stand must be recovered quickly.

## Secondary Memory

In order to prepare many recipes, the kitchen must contain enough space to store food and kitchenware. Secondary memory are **cabinets**, **fridges** and **freezers** since they can store many items and for a long period of time.

## Processor

**Stoves**, **ovens** and **microwaves** are our processors. They are crucial for preparing recipes. In the kitchen they differ in speed, power consumption, etc. The same happens with processors in computers.

## Architecture

An **architect** plans a kitchen in order to be best used. So usually the sink is close to the stand the stand is close to the stove, and so on. In Computing, a **hardware architect** plans a computer also in order to be best used. So **memory**, **processors** and **secondary memory** are located in order to maximize their efficiency.

## Programmer

Recipes are created by **chefs** and cooked by cookers. Chefs use their experience to combine different foods in a special maybe unique way. But those foods can be combined in many other ways. The same happens with programming. A problem can be solved algorithmically in many different ways.

**Cookers** follow exactly what recipes say. This process is made step by step following recipe ordering. Sometimes some ingredient is missing and the cooker may replace by another trying to simulate the missing one or giving a personal touch. In Computing, cookers are **interpreters** of a programming language. They process recipes written in a particular programming language. Unlike cookers, interpreters do not improvise when something is missing. Everything must be ready to be processed.

## Operational System

<img src="/assets/cozinha-industrial.jpg" width="640"/>

Industrial kitchen requires many more items to deliver without delay. Cook assistants help cookers to prepare plates as fast as possible. They locate food in the cabinets, clean the stand, control stove temperature, etc. In Computing, assistant's tasks are made by **Operating Systems**. They help interpreters to execute what programs are designed for.

## Input and Output Devices

Food is the feedstock of kitches. They are delivered by **providers** which can be seen as **input devices** in our computer. In the same way, what is produced by our kitches must be delivered to our clients. Delivery service can be seen as **output devices**.

Below we list an abstract of basic metaphors for this book:

<a name="analogias"></a>

| Cooking | Programming |
| :--- | :--- |
| Kitchen | Computer |
| Recipe | Program |
| Chef | Programmer |
| Cook | Interpreter |
| Cook Assistant | Operational System |
| Sink/Stand | Main Memory |
| Kitchen Cabinet/Fridge | Secondary Memory |
| Client | User |
| Providers | Input Devices |
| Delivery | Output Device |
| Recipes: Starter + Main Course + Dessert | System |
| Tools to prepare recipes | IDE |

As we presented the basic metaphors, we are ready to read the rest of the book, which relate many programming concepts to cooking tasks.
