# Preface

Popular wisdom says a man has a complete life when he plants a tree, writes a book and has a child. I think this sentence must be analysed in a more abstract way. When we plant a tree, we care about our environment. When we have a child, we love unconditionally. Writing a book, we share and endorse knowledge.

Recently I read a book of a Brazilian professor called Mario Sergio Cortella ("Pensar bem nos faz bem!"). He argues books were the first distance education platform. I think this definition awesome! I teach courses for many years and the distance ones has far-reaching use. Books indeed have this power.

Writers also attracts me. It seems too difficult to write something good without being an expert. Computer science is a subject that changes a lot. So, be an expert is a hard and continuous work. I do not know how expert I am, but I decided to publish this book when I realized my notes deserved to be shared. In fact, I even do not know whether this subject can be exhausted but it is already worth reading.

In my classes I use metaphors a lot. They are a wonderful learning resource since any complex idea can be depicted using basic notions in a student point of view. At 2012, I attended an international conference where I met professor Mary Lynn Manns. She gave me her book called [Pedagogical Patterns](http://www.pedagogicalpatterns.org "Title"). This book has a collection of pedagogical patterns selected by professors all around the world. (*Consistent Metaphor*) is a metaphor presented in this book and it made me feel happy because I had never thought about a theory behind what I did naturally. Our book has a collection of metaphors for programming learners and teachers. We adopt kitchens as an environment for creating these metaphors.

We looked forward to similar approaches to ours. Three related ideas were found: (i) a video lecture of professor Tanzeela Ali, from Superior University at Pakistan, entitled "From Psychology to Logic - Learning Computer Programming in the Kitchen"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya3fjj3ewUU); (ii) an article written by Phil Johnson entitled ["How to cook like a programmer"](http://www.itworld.com/article/2694941/virtualization/how-to-cook-like-a-programmer.html) that discusses developers cooking habits; (iii) a video lecture made by Gabriel Froes and Vanessa Weber entitled ["Programando na Cozinha"](http://codigofonte.uol.com.br/videos/programando-na-cozinha-vlog-10) which relates cooking and programming activities. Although the last video is just a step by step of cooking a recipe, video's description contains the recipe written in PHP (language for web page creation, like the page of our book). 

In this book, a developer is a chef, which knows ordinary and extraordinary recipes, such that he can invent his ones. Bon app√©tit, i.e., enjoy programming!
